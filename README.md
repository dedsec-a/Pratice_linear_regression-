Forest Fire Dataset - Machine Learning Models Practice
Welcome to my GitHub repository where I’ve practiced various machine learning models using the Forest Fire dataset. The goal of this project is to explore and showcase the performance of different regression techniques in predicting forest fire occurrences based on multiple features.

Project Overview
In this project, I applied several machine learning regression models to the Forest Fire dataset, which contains data related to meteorological and forest conditions. My objective was to predict the area of forest fire damage based on variables such as temperature, wind, and humidity.

Models Implemented:
Simple Linear Regression
A basic regression technique to establish a linear relationship between the independent variables and the target variable (forest fire area).

Lasso Regression
A regression model that introduces L1 regularization to reduce overfitting and enforce feature selection by shrinking coefficients of less significant variables to zero.

Ridge Regression
A regression model that applies L2 regularization to prevent overfitting by penalizing large coefficients and distributing weight more evenly across all variables.

Elastic Net Regression
A hybrid approach that combines both L1 and L2 regularization to leverage the strengths of both Lasso and Ridge regressions, balancing feature selection and coefficient shrinkage.

Dataset
The Forest Fire dataset contains meteorological and environmental features such as:

Temperature
Wind speed
Humidity
Rain
Fire area (target variable)
You can find the dataset here.

Results
For each model, I have evaluated performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared (R²). Comparative results demonstrate how regularization techniques improve performance, particularly when handling multicollinearity or reducing the model's complexity.

Key Insights:
Simple linear regression performs well on this dataset but is prone to overfitting.
Lasso regression performs feature selection automatically, improving generalization.
Ridge regression helps when we have many small, correlated features.
Elastic Net strikes a balance, combining the advantages of both Lasso and Ridge.
